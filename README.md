# 📝 Word & Character Counter

A simple and lightweight web-based tool designed to help users **quickly check word and character limits**, especially when filling out **online application forms, essays, SOPs, or text fields with strict input requirements**.

This tool helps avoid repeated trial-and-error while typing into platforms with limited space.

## 🎯 Why This Was Built

Many forms — including scholarship portals, college applications, job portals, and government submissions — require answers within a **fixed word or character limit**.  
Instead of typing directly into those forms and adjusting repeatedly, this tool allows you to:

- Type comfortably
- See word count live
- Adjust content before pasting it into the final form

No login. No server. No data stored. **Just type and check.**
